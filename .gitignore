# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.

# Message For Kayle
# I don't think that I can be in a polyamourous relationship. I don't want you to end your relationship with anyone else for me, but I don't think that I can be in this sort of dynamic. I've realized that I'm monogamous while you've discovered you're poly. I thought I could just deal with it and deal with my jealousy, but I can't do this. I just want a relationship where we are both our only romantic/sexual partner. I'm sorry. I read something on the Polyamory subreddit while trying to deal with this and figure some stuff out. I can't enthusiastically consent to a relationship where either my partner or I are poly. I think that means that this can't work anymore because of that. I don't want you to change who you are or push a part of yourself down for me. Since I can't ask you to do that, I have come to the conclusion that maybe we are just incompatible. 
# On that post on Reddit, I read something that really seemed to resonate with me: "If the best case scenario is a good version of something you don't want, don't do it." You don't need to move out or anything like that. You can 100% stay living in the apartment, and I'll keep paying for stuff. I just don't think that I can comfortably stay in our relationship while you are actively dating someone else besides me. 
# The issue isn't that I want to control you. The issue is that I can't feel safe or comfortable with this. I feel like this all happened way to fast without enough conversations. That is partially on me since I would just shut down, but it's also on you partially. These conversations should be stuff you are leading not me. I don't feel like you've wanted to communicate with me about this which is fine, but if that's the case, I don't think this is a healthy environment for you to be poly. 
# I'm sorry that this is happening and it's really hard for me to do this. I need to focus on making myself comfortable and safe which I can't do when I know that my partner is dating, in a relationship with, having sex with another person. I'm sorry I couldn't figure this out sooner.
# I do still love you immensly which makes this so much harder than I thought it would be. I think for both of our sakes that we should just end this relationship now before we get further into it. You can keep all the toys, clothes, stuffies, and everything else that I've bought for you. Those will always be yours. 
# I really tried to be okay with this. I tried to rationalize it and make it okay in my head. I tried to be okay with being with you while you're dating others, but I can't do this. It hurts too much. It makes me feel lesser. It makes me feel like I don't matter. All the reassurance in the world couldn't change that, I don't think.
