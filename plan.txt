Core Requirements:
Procedural World Generation: The game world should be procedurally generated each time the player starts a new game. This includes generating terrain, structures, and NPC settlements.
Procedural Character (NPC) Generation: NPCs in teh game should be procedurally generated with unique appearances, personalities, and dialogue.
Dialouge System: Implement a dialogue system that allows players to interact with NPCs using text input. NPCs should respond to player input in a dynamic and contextually relevant manner.
Custom Player Character Creation: Allow players to create their own character with customizable attributes, skills, and traits.
Survival Mechanics: Include survival elements such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue that players must manage while exploring the game world.
Exploration and Interaction: Create a rich and immersive game world with various locations to explore, items to discover, and NPCs to interact with.
Procedural AI: Implement AI behavior for NPCs that allows them to navigate the game world, interact with each other, and respond to player actions in a realistic manner.
Progression System: Include a progression system that allows players to level up their character, acquire new skills and abilities, and become more powerful over time.
Saving and Loading: Having a save system to allow the player to save their game and come back to it later at any time.

Potential Core Mechanics:
Quests and Exploration: The core mechanic could involve exploring the procedurally generated world, completing quests, and interacting with NPCs to uncover the game's story and lore.
Survival and Resource Management: Players must manage their character's survival needs while navigating the game world, including finding food and water, resting, and avoiding dangerous encounters.
Settlement Building and Management: Players can establish and maintain their own settlements, recruit NPCs to populate them, and defend them from threats.
Diplomacy and Faction Relations: The core mechanic would involve navigating the political landscape of teh game world, forming alliances with NPC factions, and influencing the outcome of conflicts through diplomacy and negotiation.
Rouge-like Dungeon Crawling: Players explore procedurally generated dungeons filled with traps, puzzles, and monsters, collecting loot and uncovering secrets as they delve deeper in the depths.
Trade and Economy: Players can engage in trading with NPCs, buying and selling goods to earn money and acquire rare items.
Dynamic Events and Encounters: The game world is filled with dynamic events and encounters that occur randomly or in response to player actions, providing opportunities for adventure and challenge.
